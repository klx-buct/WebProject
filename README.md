# NanKou Travel
In order to facilitate students to travel and reasonable plan their travel time, after discussing, we decide to develop an application about Nan Kou Travel. Its main functions are getting a travel path and realizing carpool.
Five interfaces: Home、User、Carpool、Travel and tips.

Home contains some welcome information.

Firstly, user interface shows user’s basic information and provides some functions to modify personal information, like name, gender, code and so on. We plan to use form.

Second interface is Carpool interface. It allows user to release their own carpool information and to get others’ information.

What’s more, when the user input their departure place, destination and travel time, travel interface will show three ways, the shortest way, the cheapest path and the shortest-time way.

Finally, tips can offer some useful tips about campus, for example, “Cause the sunny day, remember to take an umbrella!”
